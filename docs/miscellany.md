# Miscellany

## Motivation

Primer3 is a very mature and widely used primer design platform; however,
integrating it into more complex pipelines has historically required obtuse
subprocess wrappers and inefficient file IO. We hope that this Python API will
allow for cleaner and more efficient integration of the Primer3 core
functionalities into your projects and applications.

## Derivative work

The included `libprimer3` source is a derivative of the Primer3 v2.6.1
library that includes a number of optimizations and improvements to make it
more amenable to Python C API / Cython bindings. Every effort has been made
to insure that the underlying algorithms and calculations deterministically
product the same results as the vanilla v2.6.1 Primer3 library.

## Future work

We are happy with the current state of **Primer3-py** and have no intention of
making any major changes to the API or underlying code base in the near future.
We will provide support for bug fixes and compatibility improvements, and will
consider incorporating any changes included in major releases of the main
Primer3 project.

## Contributions

We welcome any contributions that improve the stability, compatibility or
test coverage (shoutout to pramasoul (<https://github.com/pramasoul>) for his
help with the testing framework). The best way to interface with the
project and dev team is through [primer3-py Github](<https://github.com/libnano/primer3-py>)
and review the documentation at [](quickstart.md#Contributing)
