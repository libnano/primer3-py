  `RuntimeError`s as appropriate

- Better testing framework for the design bindings
- New documentation system
- Better under-the-hood thermodynamic analysis abstraction

## Version 0.3.1 (August 13, 2014)

- (POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE) Refactored thermodynamic alignment bindings to
  always return a thermoresult namedtuple (in the previous embodiment, if no
  structure was found, the return value was `None`)

## Version 0.2.5 (August 7, 2014)

- Fixed incorrect tm/salt correction method lookups in `calcTm` function in
  both bindings and wrappers

## Version 0.2.4 (June 17, 2014)

  memory for the global parameters struct was not being properly allocated

## Version 0.2.3 (June 5, 2014)

- Corrected several potential sources of memory leaks in the C API design
  bindings.

## Version 0.2.2 (June 3, 2014)

- Corrected issue with parsing `"SEQUENCE_PRIMER_PAIR_OK_REGION_LIST"` as a
  python sequence object. `"SEQUENCE_PRIMER_PAIR_OK_REGION_LIST"` should now
  be provided as a list of lists or tuple of tuples (or a combination of the
  two). -1 should be used in the case where an index is ommitted. For example:

  ```
  Primer3 boulder IO input:   100,50,300,50 ; 900,60,,
  Primer3 python input:       [[100,50,300,50], [900,60,-1,-1]]
  ```
